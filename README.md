## Summary & Process
For this assignment, our objective was to create a book search and save app. It allows the user to search for books by title and returns a variety of books with associated titles with their associated description and cover image.

My team began this project by establishing the MVC strucutre and React Provider. The next step was to make sure that the React file structures were established which included App.js, pages, and components. We then constructed the Search and Save pages one by one.

## Takeaways

Understanding how to implement useContext and Providers with a React App can avoid the hazards of prop drilling. However, doing so can make the file structure more difficult to understand. When undertaking this type of structure, be sure to familiarize yourself with how all files work together.
